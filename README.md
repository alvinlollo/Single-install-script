# Single-install-script

This script automatically installs you favourite Linux applications such as:
Docker, Homebrew, code server, zsh, GEF, oh-my-zsh and more to come!

It also installs custom configuration for zsh and it's plugins.

If you don't like the configurations fork this and edit to you liking.

Please consider staring this project. It helps me see how important this is for everyone.

## Usage

To use this script paste the following in the Linux terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinlollo/Single-install-script/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

I am working on a beta version of the script with a selection menu, it is untested

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinlollo/Single-install-script/refs/heads/main/installbeta.sh | bash
```

If you have any issues please add one in the issues tab.
